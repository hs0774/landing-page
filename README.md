# landing-page
This is the landing page where I will put my flexbox skills to the test
I did occasionally have to look at the solutions when i was doing those problems
despite being advised against it. Though I would start the projects a new and try again
from memory and understand how flexbox works. eventually i was able to do them not from 
memory but by looking at the code and seeing what each container does. I hope the knowledge
gained from those problems will transfer over to the landing page. I feel confident because
immediately when i saw the landing page my mind started to see various containers and i think 
i have a good idea of what the html will look like before get started on it.
